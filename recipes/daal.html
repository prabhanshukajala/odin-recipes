    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Any combination of lentils or dal can be used to make this dal. Generally panchmel dal or chaar dal is made. Today, I have made this dal with a combination of Chana dal and Hari chilkewali dal. I.e. Bengal gram and green split moong dal.

    <p>
        Dal has to be spicy and flavourful bursting with flavours from the different spices. I have also done a generous tadka using ginger, garlic, green chillies and a few spices.
