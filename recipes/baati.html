    <p>
        Rajasthani Dal Bati Churma Recipe is a very traditional recipe from Rajasthan and one if the favorites at home. The Baatis are made from whole wheat flour, sooji and ghee with the addition of ajwain that adds to the delicious flavor of the baati.

    <p>
        Baatis are the flatbreads or rolls as you call. They are made using whole wheat flour. Generally made in a tandoor. I do not have a tandoor so I made them in an oven as well as in a pressure cooker. Both the methods had the same result, but I would go with the oven method as it takes less time then the pressure cooker method.

        The baati’s once cooked are soaked in ghee. And you will be amazed at the amount of ghee the bati absorbs. The baatis are then eaten along with the dal. 

        Baati’s can be stuffed too and can be made using different flours. But the basic or the traditional baati is made using whole wheat flour.
